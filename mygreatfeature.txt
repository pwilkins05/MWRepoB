This is my idea for a great feature.

My feature would allow you to have coffee and muffins delivered to your desk whenever you request it.

This would be implemented by drones who could open doors and carry coffee and muffins as payload.

The drones would have lights and make beeping sounds when they traversed hallways.  There would be protective cages around the blades to protect bystanders.

The delivery drones would be equipped with tasers to protect their valuable payload.
